### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I work on computer vision + deep learning
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on applications of hyperbolic geometry (refer hyperbolic learning [survey paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06611) from my lab) and hyperspherical geometry (refer [my NeurIPS 2022 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08704)) in computer vision.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for collaborators on my projects. If that's you, let's get in touch. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about grad school application advice.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: DM [me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/tkasarla_) or email me.
